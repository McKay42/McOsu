# McOsu

An unofficial open-source client for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) focused on customizing gameplay and facilitating practice.
This client does not include gameplay tutorials and will not be useful for those new to osu!

Runs on McEngine: [https://github.com/McKay42/McEngine](https://github.com/McKay42/McEngine)

Feedback, requests, bug reports, etc. can be made on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/3UQnt7X).

## Installation
The client can be downloaded from [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/607260/McOsu/). The source code can be downloaded (here)[https://github.com/McKay42/McOsu/releases].

Binaries are available for **Windows** and **Linux**, and potentially macOS in the future.

**NOTE:** Linux support is still under development. Some functions (e.g. native fullscreen mode and raw input) do not work.
