An unofficial open-source client for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) with the main focus on making practicing easier and customizing gameplay. If you have never played osu! before then I do not recommend using this client, as there are no gameplay tutorials in here.

Runs on McEngine: [https://github.com/McKay42/McEngine](https://github.com/McKay42/McEngine)

Binaries are available for **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**.

Note that Linux and macOS support is not as polished as Windows, and some functions like raw input or mouse sensitivity may not work (correctly) there.

## Notable features which osu! doesn't have (yet) in comparison:
- Virtual Reality support (HTC Vive + Oculus Rift)
- Mid-play empty section skipping
- Beatmap scrubbing (CTRL + ALT + Click drag)
- Override CS/AR/HP/OD
- Speed/BPM changer
- Change mods while playing
- Actually useful target practice mod
- Experimental mods (Wobble, First Person, Minimize, Playfield flipping, Jigsaw, etc.)
- Properly drawn playfield border
- Arbitrary HUD scale (Combo counter, accuracy, etc.)
- Enable/Disable approach circles, numbers, sliderendcircles, followpoints or any other element
- Ignore beatmap sample volume
- Enhanced hit error bar, shows misaims and extra clicks
- Nearly unlimited customizability using console commands for people who want to tinker with everything (e.g. osu_playfield_rotation, osu_circle_fade_out_time, osu_skip_time, etc.)

## System Requirements:
- GPU with OpenGL 3.0 support or higher
