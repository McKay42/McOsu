An unofficial open-source client for [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) with the main focus on making practicing easier and customizing gameplay. If you have never played osu! before then I do not recommend using this client, as there are no gameplay tutorials in here.

Runs on McEngine: [https://github.com/McKay42/McEngine](https://github.com/McKay42/McEngine)

Binaries are available for **Windows** and **Linux**, and maybe macOS in the future.
Note that Linux support is not as polished as Windows, and some functions such as native fullscreen mode or raw input do not work there yet.

## Notable features which osu! doesn't have (yet) in comparison:
- Mid-play empty section skipping
- Beatmap scrubbing (CTRL + ALT + Click drag)
- Override CS/AR/HP/OD
- Speed/BPM changer
- Change mods while playing
- Actually useful target practice mod
- Experimental mods (Wobble, First Person, Minimize, Playfield flipping, Jigsaw, etc.)
- The choice to use Score V2 in singleplayer
- Properly drawn playfield border
- Arbitrary HUD scale (Combo counter, accuracy, etc.)
- Enable/Disable approach circles, numbers, sliderendcircles, followpoints or any other element
- Ignore beatmap sample volume
- Enhanced hit error bar, shows misaims and extra clicks
- Nearly unlimited customizability using console commands for people who want to tinker with everything (e.g. osu_playfield_rotation, osu_circle_fade_out_time, osu_skip_time, etc.)

## System Requirements:
- GPU with OpenGL 3.0 support or higher
